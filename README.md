# RUDPy3
A Python3 version of a Reliable UDP file transfer(no encryption tho) based on https://github.com/mamgad/RUDPy and various other sources.

The reason why its not a library is because there are way too many knobs that will take quite some time to facilitate. Just go through source, and you should (hopefully) be fine :)
